# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This notebook explores Python-based machine learning and data science libraries such as Scikit-learn to build a predictive model that determines whether or not a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

## Data Source

The original dataset is sourced from the Cleveland data available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

## Features

The dataset includes the following key features:

- **Age** (Feature 3)
- **Sex** (Feature 4)
- **Chest Pain Type (cp)** (Feature 9)
- **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)** (Feature 10)
- **Cholesterol (chol)** (Feature 12)
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)** (Feature 16)
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)** (Feature 19)
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)** (Feature 32)
- **Exercise Induced Angina (exang)** (Feature 38)
- **ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak)** (Feature 40)
- **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)** (Feature 41)
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)** (Feature 44)
- **Thalassemia (thal)** (Feature 51)
- **Num diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (Feature 58)

## Notebook Environment

This project is developed and executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment and makes extensive use of Python libraries, including:

- **pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** for numerical computations
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization
- **scikit-learn** for building, evaluating, and tuning the machine learning models
